The aim of this Coursera Course "HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers" was to create a responsive site without using any 
pre-existing Bootstrap frameworks. 

The site has 3 different breakpoints. 
A desktop version of the site when the width of the browser window is 992px and above.
A tablet view appears only if the width of the browser window is between 768px and 991px.
And a mobile view appears only if the width of the browser is equal to or less than 767px.

In the desktop view (992px and above), each of the 3 sections take up equal amount of space on the screen.
In the tablet view (between 768px and 991px, inclusively), the first 2 sections are in the first row and of equal size 
while the 3rd section is in the second row and takes up the entire row by itself.
In the mobile view (equal to or less than 767px), each section takes up the entire row.
